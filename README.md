# Snakes and Ladders Java
For Introduction to Programming Semester 1 2017  
Code checked April 2020

## Background
The assignment was to define the logic of the Snakes and Ladders game, including setting up the board and placing the snakes, ladders and traps. Our work was mostly focused on the `SLGame.java` file; the other aspects of the game were already done as part of the startup code.

## How to run
Import the repo to Eclipse as a project and run `SLGame.java`.

## Notes
- When a player rolls a six, they get another turn. However, due to the arrangement of the code, snakes, ladders and traps do not have any effect on the player during this extra turn.
